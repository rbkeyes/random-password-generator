# Random Password Generator

## Description

This random password generator creates a random string of characters to match the indicated length and selected character types input by the user. The page consists of a white background with the heading "Password Generator" at the top & center, a box in the center of the page with the heading "Generate a Password", a dashed border, and placeholder text reading "Your Secure Password". A red button with white text reading "Generate Password" is located below the box. The user can customize their selections to meet their specific password needs, including length of password as well as inclusion of upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. This was a good opportunity to practice writing for loops, using window prompt/confirmation/alert, and to study methods for selecting random characters using JavaScript. It also strengthened my understanding of functions and event listeners.
